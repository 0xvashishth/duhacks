DUHacks is a 36-hour National-Level hybrid hackathon organized by Google Developer Student Club, DDU in which all participants can sharpen their skills and connect with people to grow together. The hackathon is designed to spark innovation, attract and educate new talent and create new channels for collaboration between performance and capacity professionals. We aim to spread the idea that programming is a useful skill that everyone can learn. We want to host approximately 150 students offline in the institution with proper preparation, as well as 150+ students online. Only DDU students are allowed to attend this hackathon in offline mode. Rest all students from across the nation can participate this hackathon in online mode.
